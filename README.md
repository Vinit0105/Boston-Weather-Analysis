The project provides a comprehensive analysis of weather data in Boston spanning from 2013 to 2023. 
It offers valuable insights into temperature fluctuations, precipitation patterns, and weather variations over time, 
leveraging various statistical methods and visualiza5on techniques. Weak negative correlations between average temperature and precipitation were uncovered, 
shedding light on their nuanced relationship. 
Additionally, through the examination of rainy days and descriptive statistics for key weather metrics, 
significant aspects of Boston's climate dynamics were revealed.
